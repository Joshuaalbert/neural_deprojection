Roadmap for Galaxy Cluster deprojection of Chandra X-ra to ICM
    
    1. Understand galaxy cluster science (stretch goal: long time)
    2. Collaboration A: Understand supervised learning (stretch goal)
    3. What is the ICM (physical properties, etc.)?
    4. What is limiting galaxy cluster research?
    5. What is magneticum?
    6. Collaboration B: What are the state-of-art method of ICM reconstruction?
    7. Milestone: explain during group meeting the limiting factors and state-of-art ICM reconstruction methods.
    8. Collaboration C: Set up a computing  environment for experimenting
    9. How do the snapshots of mag-sim convert to physical quantities?
    10. How to go from SPH → field of physical properties.
    11. How does SOXS work?
    12. What is gradient descent (training a neural network).
    13. What is a computation graph.
    14. Tensorflow (stretch goal).
    15. Create the  training data pipeline.
    16. Collaboration D: Learn how to visualise 3D volumes with mayavi (a pythonic interface to beautiful plotting).
    17. Milestone: Show group pretty pictures of the input/output data (show the problem to group).
    18. Understand what vanilla neural networks (feedforward, CNN).
    19. Understand the hyperparameter space (parameters of the architecture, training program, etc.)
    20. Explore different representations of the data (permutation invariant inputs and maybe outputs).
    21. Collaboration E: Understand deprojection (graph networks).
    22. Build the inversion pipeline (version 1, aka proof of concept).
    23. Milestone: Run one training loop. (It’ll likely be kind of disappointing).
    24. Understand how to intelligently explore hyperparameter space.
    25. Set up a training pipeline that explores hyperparameter space, that produces visual diagnostics, checkpointing, managing compute cluster.
    26. Run second loop (much bigger).
    27. Milestone: Show first result of ICM reconstruction.
    28. Write first draft of thesis.
    29. July 31 submit thesis

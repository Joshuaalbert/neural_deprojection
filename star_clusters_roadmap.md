 Roadmap for Star Cluster deprojection of Gaia observales to star cluster ICs.
 
    1. Understand star clusters (stretch goal: long time)
    2. Collaboration A: Vanilla neural network architectures and training protocols (stretch goal)
    3. What is the ISM?
    4. Star cluster real ICs
    5. What is limiting star cluster science
    6. Collaboration B: What is the state-of-art IC inference from real data?
    7. Milestone: explain to group limiting factors and state-of-art.
    8. Collaboration C: Setting up the computing environment
    9. Learn about AMUSE (how it works).
    10. How are stars represented in a simulation?
    11. How are the dynamics imposed?
    12. Star cluster simulation ICs
    13. Simulating Gaia observables: Antony Brown
    14. Build your training data generation pipeline
    15. Collaboration D: Understand data visualisation: both the 3D ISM and Gaia observables, maybe with mayavi (a pythonic interface to beautiful plotting).
    16. Milestone: show visualisations to the group
    17. Tensorflow (stretch goal)
    18. Collaboration E: Understanding deprojection
    19. Graph representations
    20. Understanding hyperparameters
    21. Build your first deprojection algorithm
    22. Milestone: Train the first deprojection algorithm (proof of concept, will be disappointing)
    23. Learn how to optimise hyperparameters
    24. Setup a full training pipeline
    25. Running and monitoring the full training pipeline (see improving results)
    26. Milestone: show first reconstruction of ICs to group
    27. Write your first draft
    28. Submit July 31
